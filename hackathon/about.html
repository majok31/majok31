					<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px; font-family: candara; padding-right: 30px;margin-right: 10px; margin-left: 10px;">Within the next 25 years the population of Africa will roughly double from 1 to 2 Billion, most babies being born in rural villages. These rapidly growing Communities can either become desert slums dependent on Western Food Aid, or… Value Villages.<br><br><br>
Since 2011 the German foundation Hilfsverein Nymphenburg has made East Africa one of its focus regions for funding projects. Our special advantage was, that we were working with a variety of very different partner organizations, such as Catholic Missionaries, Agriculture Organizations from Israel, local governments, and small Self-Help groups from local communities. All of them had a different structure and approach to tackle the same basic problems. In 2018 the Board decided to use all this experience, including the knowledge of all our partners, to create a new framework for our projects: Value Villages. It will bring about a better cooperation between our partner organizations and help to fill in the gaps on the path to more sustainable development, with new and specifically designed projects that aim to tackle adult education and income generation. Value Villages will officially be launched on the 85th Birthday of Duke Francis of Bavaria, the Chairman of Hilfsverein Nymphenburg and for the first time be presented at the Charity Auction Helfen ohne Limit.

					<h2 style="font-size: 30px; font-family: stensil; text-align: center; text-transform: uppercase; color:rgb(92, 177, 143);">The Problem </h2>
					<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px; font-family: candara; padding-right: 30px;margin-right: 10px; margin-left: 10px;">Vast areas of the African continent are so cut off from education and development, that it seems almost impossible to catch up with the rest of the world.<br><br><br> 
Rural nomadic villages in Africa have the greatest proportion of people living in extreme poverty. For example, in Turkana County, the area of our pilot project, more than 95% of the population live on less than $1 a day. The regions’ environmental, epidemiological and geographical challenges - including low-productivity agriculture, a high disease burden, lack of a contextbased education system and the high transport costs render these communities vulnerable to persistent extreme poverty. This means that there is lack of basic needs; for example, to collect safe drinking water, if it is to be found at all, people must walk several miles every day. With these rural communities stuck in a cycle of poverty, they are unable to make investments into human capital and infrastructure that is required to achieve selfsustaining economic growth. For many years, people and development agencies in Turkana County, like the rest of northern Kenya, have worked at alleviating extreme poverty so that the poorest people can access basic goods and services for survival; like food, safe drinking water, sanitation, shelter and education. Many organizations and the government are providing aid, but often on an emergency need basis, rather than long term sustainable planning. This can even make the situation worse, since it creates dependency while increasing the demographic problem. Established approaches to development aid like microcredits, or investments in agricultural or industrial projects are failing. There is too little of a buying force to start a business, too little rain for agriculture and limited education opportunities or infrastructure to set up a normal business model as it is done in more developed regions. As a result, the gap between the rich and the poor, urban and rural, between groups or between genders reveal huge disparities between those who are well endowed and those who are deprived.

					<h2 style="font-size: 30px; font-family: stensil; text-align: center; text-transform: uppercase; color:rgb(92, 177, 143);">Why Value Villages? </h2>
					<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px; font-family: candara; padding-right: 30px;margin-right: 10px; margin-left: 10px;">We cannot help everybody, but we can see through what we start.<br><br><br>
 Rather than trying to solve this problem for the entire region, we look at that one village at the time. We make sure that the selected communities receive not just punctual aid that will increase their dependency, but a full set of measures that will eventually help them to become self-sufficient. We are providing a long-term plan which includes road access, clean water, health, education and business opportunities. The role of Value Villages is to coordinate between partner organizations to make this happen and to provide the management and follow up on the ground. If there is no partner organization available for certain aspects of the plan, for example income generation for the illiterate part of the villagers, Value Villages steps in with its own programs, like vocational training and international Fair Trade of locally manufactured products. Over a 10-year period spanning two five-year phases, value villages will have developed community committee’s capacity to continue these initiatives and develop a solid foundation for sustainable growth

					<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px; font-family: candara; padding-right: 30px;margin-right: 10px; margin-left: 10px;">First, we select the communities to become Value Villages 
Our focus is on remote communities of 100 to 500 households that have little or no connection to the developed world. We are looking at illiteracy levels of up to 95 % for adults, and for children in many cases they have no access to schools. The average household income is less than one US $ per day, and there is currently little to no other economic income. The normal way of living is in “Manyattas”, simple houses constructed out of palm leaves or other available materials, and in many cases, there is no access to medication and medical services. Most of these communities already receive food aid, which has allowed for the comunity population to grow, but now have become unable to sustain themselves with their livestock or other traditional methods. The first four locations picked, do not start at zero, as they have already benefited from projects of the Hilfsverein Nymphenburg; such as water solutions and early childhood education. Currently approximately 1200 Households in the four different sites in northern Kenya are beneficiaries of these projects. Each Value Village site is located in a distinct location with numerous challenges. Create a Vision for each individual Village For every Community we welcome into the program we first develop a Village Vision. It is a blue print for development that follows a number of stages for each location. After taking care of the most basic needs for life in this village, we make sure that every child has an education, and that the
